# Linear-Time-Tree-Generator

The header file utree.hpp includes a c++20 template<class pseudo_random_number_generator_t> class undirected_tree.

The class constructor two parameters:

1. size_t size: that specifies the number of nodes in the tree.
2. pseudo_random_number_generator& random: that passed to the constructor reference to the PRNG used to generate the tree. 

The cycle-free tree consists of (size) distinct nodes laballed 1..size, and (size-1) distinct undirected edges (u,v) between differnt nodes u and v, such that there exists a single path between any two nodes in the tree. 

The generated tree is stored in the class object as a vector of (size-1) pairs of nodes that represent edges of the tree. 
  
Example:
  
The following tree was generated by the example program in main.cpp when N = 9.
  
2 7
  
3 2
  
9 2
  
3 6
  
4 2
  
3 1
  
9 8
  
5 8
